## 🎤 Key Interview Answers

### "Tell me about your technical experience"

"I love solving problems through automation. At Planning Center, I've created custom GPT systems that help our entire team—Spanish support, bug reports, feature requests—and trained everyone on how to use them. Outside of work, I've built a full-stack SaaS product (Groovi), implemented CRM systems with GoHighLevel, and deployed AI chatbots. These projects taught me how to build robust solutions, which I apply when creating internal tools that actually get adopted."

### "Why are you the right person for this role?"

"Three reasons: First, I'm passionate about this work—I naturally gravitate toward building solutions and sharing them with the team. Second, I bring both technical skills and support experience, so I build tools that agents actually want to use. Third, I'd love to support Zach with additional bandwidth while bringing fresh perspectives from my external automation work. I see this as a chance to focus fully on what I enjoy most: making our team's work easier through thoughtful automation."

### "What would you do in your first 30 days?"

"First, I'd sit down with Zach to understand current priorities and systems—I want to complement his work, not duplicate it. Then I'd document the tools I've built so they're more accessible to the team. I'd identify 3-5 quick wins based on my support experience and start building. Most importantly, I'd establish a feedback loop with the team to ensure I'm building what actually helps. By day 30, I'd have shipped improvements and have a roadmap aligned with Zach's vision."

### "How do you approach building vs. buying?"

"I always prefer existing tools, they're faster and more maintainable. But sometimes we need something specific. For example, I created our Spanish Support GPT because no translation service understood Planning Center's terminology. Instead of waiting for a perfect solution, I built something that helped immediately, then refined it based on team feedback. My philosophy: start with what exists, build when necessary, and always iterate based on real usage."

### "Describe a complex automation you've built"

"My Spanish Support GPT is deceptively complex. It handles:
- Product terminology (never translate 'Planning Center' or 'Check-Ins')
- Tone matching (supportive, not overly formal)
- Context awareness (recognizes UI elements)
- Pattern recognition (identifies button names vs. regular text)

But the real complexity was change management—training the team, documenting edge cases, ensuring adoption. Technical implementation is only half the battle; the other half is making sure people actually use it."
