## Project Overview: Revolutionizing QR & NFC Management

**Groovi QR & NFC** is a complete SaaS platform I built from concept to production that gives businesses complete control over their QR codes and NFC tags. Unlike static QR codes that point to one destination forever, Groovi enables dynamic management with scheduling, playlists, and campaign switching.

**Live Platform:** [groovi.cc](https://groovi.cc)

## The Problem: Static QR Codes Don't Work for Modern Business

Traditional QR codes have a fundamental limitation: they're static. Once printed, they point to one destination forever. This creates massive problems for:

- **Events**: QR codes printed for registration become useless after the event
- **Restaurants**: Menu QRs can't switch to reservations during off-hours
- **Retail**: Promotional QRs require reprinting for every new campaign
- **Education**: Classroom QRs can't adapt to different lessons or resources

## My Solution: Dynamic QR & NFC Platform

I designed and built a comprehensive platform that solves these problems through three core innovations:

### 1. Dynamic Playlists
**One QR Code, Multiple Destinations**

Create sequences of destinations that your QR code cycles through:
- Automatically rotate through playlist items on schedule
- Manually control rotation in real-time
- Mix different content types: websites, phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp, email

**Example Playlist:**
1. Website: company.com/promotion
2. Phone: Call our hotline  
3. WhatsApp: Chat with support
4. Email: Sign up for newsletter

### 2. Smart Scheduling
**Auto-Updates Based on Time**

Set QR codes to automatically change destinations:
- Time-based switching (lunch menu → dinner menu)
- Date-based campaigns (holiday promotions)
- Event schedules (registration → agenda → feedback)

**Real-World Example - Restaurant:**
- **11 AM - 3 PM**: Menu website
- **3 PM - 11 AM**: Phone for reservations
- **Special Events**: WhatsApp for event booking

### 3. Campaign Switching
**Same QR, Different Actions**

Switch between action types instantly:
- Website → Phone Call → SMS → Email → WhatsApp
- No reprinting required
- Perfect for evolving campaigns

### 4. Unified QR & NFC Management
**One Platform, Two Technologies**

Manage both QR codes and NFC tags with:
- Cross-platform synchronization
- Combined analytics dashboard
- Omnichannel customer experiences
