## The Training Challenge at Planning Center

As Planning Center's tools evolved and AI capabilities expanded, our support team needed rapid training on complex technical concepts. Traditional training approaches weren't keeping pace with the speed of innovation our customers needed.

**Core Challenges:**
- Team members learning different productivity tools inconsistently
- "Technically impossible" requests (HTML/Liquid coding) leaving customers stranded
- New AI tools requiring prompt engineering skills
- Knowledge silos preventing team-wide capability growth

## My Training Philosophy

**"I don't just build tools, I ensure they get used."**

Every training system I create includes:
- **Hands-on practice** with real scenarios
- **Visual documentation** with step-by-step guides
- **Interactive tools** that guide users through complex processes
- **Ongoing support** until adoption becomes second nature

## Training Systems Developed

### 1. AI Productivity Training Program

**Challenge:** Team needed to leverage AI for efficiency without compromising quality.

**Training Created:**
- [ChatGPT Productivity Training Guide](https://www.notion.so/planningcenter/Chat-GPT-Productivity-hack-25cabbce69a280c0a038dd7b84655533)
- [Bug Report Automation GPT](https://cloud.pco.bz/j28zgHQW) - Standardized engineering handoffs
- [Planning Center Support Chatbot](https://cloud.pco.bz/8dxFsZFy) - Customer-ready responses
- [Video-to-Documentation Workflow](https://www.notion.so/planningcenter/Creating-a-Notion-Training-Document-Using-ClearShot-Transcript-Browser-Recorder-and-ChatGPT-21eabbce69a280eeb8cbcdf0e00407e2)

**Results:**
- **20% faster response times** through AI-assisted workflows
- **100% team adoption** of productivity GPTs
- **Standardized technical documentation** across entire support team

### 2. Custom Report Builder Training

**Challenge:** HTML/Liquid coding requests were "technically impossible" for support agents, leaving customers frustrated.

**Solution:** Built visual training system enabling non-technical agents to handle complex coding requests.

**Training Components:**
- [Custom Report Builder Guide](https://www.notion.so/planningcenter/Calendar-Custom-Report-29ed64e46dff4b1680d1af55b546961f)
- Interactive workflow: User objectives → Structured JSON → AI-generated code
- Visual step-by-step process guides
- Real customer examples and troubleshooting scenarios

**Impact:**
- **"Impossible" became achievable** - Team can now handle complex HTML/Liquid requests
- **Customer satisfaction improved** - No more "we can't help with that" responses
- **Knowledge democratized** - Technical capabilities spread across entire team

### 3. Calendar Specialist Training Portfolio

**Comprehensive Program:**
- [Training Sessions Archive](https://www.notion.so/planningcenter/f84a33e10fbd461eba79750a749ae394?v=23f08d86c65d47efa9b3b03e3914606c) - Complete learning path
- Advanced Calendar features and automation workflows
- Customer scenario practice with feedback loops
- Ongoing skill development tracking

**Results:**
- **Reduced escalation rate** for complex Calendar requests
- **Increased agent confidence** handling advanced features
- **Consistent quality** across all Calendar support interactions

## External Training Experience

## Training Methodology & Framework

### My Systematic Approach

**1. Understand the Real Problem**
- Interview team members about pain points
- Identify gaps between current and needed capabilities
- Map learning objectives to business outcomes

**2. Create Interactive Learning Experiences**
- Visual guides with real examples, not just theory
- Hands-on practice with immediate feedback
- Progressive skill building from basic to advanced

**3. Build Tools That Guide Users**
- Interactive workflows that prevent errors
- Templates and frameworks for consistent results
- Built-in guardrails for quality control

**4. Ensure Adoption Through Support**
- Follow-up sessions to address questions
- Ongoing iteration based on user feedback
- Success metrics tracking and improvement

### Visual Documentation Standards

**Every training resource includes:**
- **Clear objectives** - What will you be able to do?
- **Step-by-step visuals** - Screenshots with annotations
- **Real examples** - Actual customer scenarios
- **Troubleshooting guides** - Common issues and solutions
- **Practice opportunities** - Safe environment to learn

## Results & Impact Metrics

### Team Development Outcomes
- **60% reduction in onboarding time** for new technical tools
- **100% adoption rates** for AI productivity systems
- **Elimination of "impossible" customer responses** through upskilling
- **Increased team confidence** handling complex technical requests

### Business Impact

- **Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing** following formal training

## Why This Matters for Support Operations

### Demonstrates Core Competencies

**Agent Training & Onboarding:**
- Lead training on Front and CX tool stack ✓
- Maintain documentation based on system changes ✓
- Respond to ongoing agent questions in support channels ✓

**Technical Documentation:**
- Collaborate on guides and system documentation ✓
- Document troubleshooting steps and best practices ✓
- Create interactive tools for complex processes ✓

**Learning Agility:**
- Learn tools through experimentation ✓
- Translate documentation into implementation ✓
- Grow through iteration and feedback ✓

### Philosophy Alignment with Planning Center Values

**"Invest in Our Team"** - Build solutions that help the CX department do its best work
**"Think Holistically, Work Iteratively"** - Understand system connections while shipping improvements
**"Engage with Humility"** - Approach training with curiosity and openness to iteration

## The Training Multiplier Effect

The most impactful aspect of my training systems isn't just individual skill development - it's creating **knowledge multipliers** where one person's learning spreads throughout the team.

When agents master the Custom Report Builder, they don't just solve their own HTML/Liquid challenges - they help teammates tackle similar requests. When the Spanish Support AI gets adopted, it doesn't just help one agent - it transforms our entire multilingual support capability.

**That's the power of systematic technical training: turning individual capabilities into organizational strengths.**
